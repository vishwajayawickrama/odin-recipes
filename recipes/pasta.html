    <h1>Pasta</h1>
    <img src="Pasta.webp" alt="Image Of a Pasta">
    <p>Pasta is a type of food made from a mixture of flour, eggs, and water that is formed <br> 
        into different shapes and then boiled. Spaghetti, macaroni, and noodles are types of pasta.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with water, put the lid on and bring to the boil over a high heat.</li>
        <li>Add a good pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. 
            To tell if your pasta is cooked, try a piece about a 
            minute or so before the end of the cooking time. It’s 
            ready when it’s soft enough to eat, but still has a bit 
            of bite. 
            The Italians say ‘al dente’.
        </li>
        <li>Scoop out a mugful of the starchy cooking water and set aside. This will help emulsify the pasta sauce.</li>
        
    </ol>
